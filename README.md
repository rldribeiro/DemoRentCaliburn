# Weekend Technical Challenge

 

## Context 

 

SimpleSoft is a small Software House specialize in delivering customize Windows Applications (WPF and C#) for all kinds of industries and small businesses.

Our salesperson identified a major opportunity in the Car Renting business.  

 

### Car Renting Information System â€“ MVP 

#### Context 

DemoRent is a medium company specialized in Car Renting with more than 20 years of experience. Their business still relies on old and out-of-date practices.   

They have a small web site with all the available cars, that is kept manually by an administrative.  

Usually a customer does a phone call to DemoRent to clarify any doubts and to book a date to sign contract and pick the car at the DemoRent site. 

When a phone call is received, an administrative needs to look for a physical file to get all the car information, and if a customer books the car, an event is created in the Outlook and a note is manually added to the physical file.  

 

#### International contest 

DemoRent is launching a contest to build a new software to Digital Transform their business. 

The first phase of the context is to build a Prototype / MVP.
